# 3D Computer Game Tech (Rendering & Physics Simulation)

Welcome to my 3D Computer Game Project, which serves as a experimenting/learning game technologies (physics simulation & rendering) ,applying memory management, optimization along with computer/game arcitecture.

|*Current Milestone.*|

## Goals

<p> The primary aim of this project is to deepen my understanding of: 

-  3D game development cycle
- Advance C++ programming techniques.
- Algorithms and data strutures relevant to game technologies.
- Memory management and optimization.
- 3D physics simulation in game development (through transfering 2D knowlegde to 3D).
- 3D Rendering techniques

</p>
<h3> Sub-Goals </h3>
<p> Secondary goals:

- Program a solid basic 3D Renderer (current project) with Configuration type as dynamic linked libary (.dll).
- Return/continue with physics simulation (different project) after basis renderer (.dll) foundation is complete for linking.
- Advance Rendering simulation techniques with focus on lighting physics.
- Optimization techniques for rendering (Memory management). 
  
</p>

<h2> Current Features </h2>

<p> Implemented foundation game architecture and basic 3D renderer (model-view-projection and basic lighting) with OpenGL:

- Intergrated foundational game architecture components such as Game Loop, GameObject and Rendering pipeline.
- Mesh construction.
- Camera/View (model-view-projection).
- Lighting (Ambient + Diffuse).
- Light Source (Directional, Point, Spot).
</p>
<h3>External Libaries</h3>
<p>  Current libaries in use: GLM, GLEW, GLFW, stb-image.</p>
